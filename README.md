# Ace-editor-multiple-sessions-tabbed
Example of loading multiple code editor sessions using the Ace Code editor - Implemented in a Google Apps Script Web App

This example shows the Ace code editor being used to load multiple files,
and create multiple editor sessions that the user can open and close
by using the tabs.

This example is set up in a Google Apps Script Web App.
It is a basic example.
The code editor is started, and then content is loaded into the code editor
by clicking a button, much the same way that you would load a file into the code editor.
When a second file is loaded, a second tab is created, but both sessions are still active
even though only one will be displayed at a time.
